In this Challenge assignment, we build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.
The goal of the program is to achieve following:
* Analyze a single asset in the ETF
* Optimize data access with Advanced SQL queries
* Analyze the ETF portfolio
* Deploy the notebook as a web application

## Technologies

> Program uses Python 3.10.6 version and Jupyter Lab

Program uses 'Pandas' library to work with dataframes and analyse timeseries data. 
Program uses 'hvplot.pandas' libraries for visualization 
Most importantly 'Voila' is used to convert notebook file into an web application.
